                      At AGAPE Church, we come together each week to praise and worship our Lord God in unity and joy. Through heartfelt worship, prayer, and the teaching of the Word, we seek to grow deeper in our relationship with Jesus Christ and live out His love in our daily lives.
                      
                      We believe that the Word of God is living and powerful, and we are committed to sharing it together as a church family. Each service is an opportunity to learn, be encouraged, and be transformed by His truth.
                      
                      If you are planning to visit, our friendly members are here to welcome you and help you find your way. We meet every Sunday, and someone from our hospitality team will gladly assist you in locating our gathering place and making you feel at home.
