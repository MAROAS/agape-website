                <h2>About Our Church</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to AGAPE Church—a place where love, faith, and community come together in the presence of God. 
                    We are a Christ-centered congregation that opens its doors to everyone, regardless of background or experience. 
                    Whether you're new to the faith, returning after time away, or simply looking for a spiritual home, you are warmly invited to join us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At AGAPE Church, we come together each week to praise and worship our Lord God in unity and joy. 
                    Through heartfelt worship, prayer, and the teaching of the Word, we seek to grow deeper in our relationship with Jesus Christ 
                    and live out His love in our daily lives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We believe that the Word of God is living and powerful, and we are committed to sharing it together as a church family. 
                    Each service is an opportunity to learn, be encouraged, and be transformed by His truth.
